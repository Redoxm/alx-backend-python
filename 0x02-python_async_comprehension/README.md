Python Async comprehension
~

An asynchronous comprehension allows a list, set, or dict to be created using the “async for” expression with an asynchronous iterable. We propose to allow using async for inside list, set and dict comprehensions. This will create and schedule coroutines or tasks as needed and yield their results into a list.

Python has extensive support for synchronous comprehensions, allowing to produce lists, dicts, and sets with a simple and concise syntax. We propose implementing similar syntactic constructions for the asynchronous code.

To illustrate the readability improvement, consider the following example:
